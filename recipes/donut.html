          <h3>Make the dough:</h3>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer
            fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the frothy yeast mixture
            along with the eggs and butter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mix on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes,
            stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Increase the speed to
            medium and knead the dough for 4 more minutes. The dough will be
            slightly sticky and mostly clear sides of the bowl but may still
            stick to the bottom.
          </p>

          <h3>Proof the dough:</h3>
          <p>
            Transfer the dough to a large, lightly greased bowl, turning to
            coat, and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap. Place the dough
            in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

        <li>
          <h3>Roll out the dough and proof again:</h3>
          <p>
            Once proofed, punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly
            floured surface. Roll the dough into a circle roughly 12 inches in
            diameter that is 1/2 inch thick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out about 12 rounds. Use a 1-inch
            cutter to cut out the center holes of each donut, reserving the
            holes to fry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gather any scraps and roll them into balls about the size of the
            holes. Transfer the donuts to a parchment-lined baking sheet and the
            holes to another parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing the cut dough
            at least 1/2 inch apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover both baking sheets with lightly greased plastic wrap. Let rise
            once more in a warm place for about 30 minutes. The dough is proofed
            when you gently touch a donut and the dough slowly bounces back.

        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Fry the Donuts:</h3>
          <p>
            Fill a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot (like a Dutch oven) with
            about 2 to 3 inches of oil; it should reach no more than halfway up
            the pot. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 350째F.
          </p>
          <p>
            Line a platter or baking sheet with paper towels and set a wire rack
            over another baking sheet, placing both by your pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without overcrowding the pot, fry 2 to 3 donuts at a time, turning
            once, until golden brown all over and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a
            slotted spoon, kitchen spider, or chopsticks to transfer the donuts
            to the paper towels to drain for 1 minute, then transfer to the wire
            rack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Return the oil to 350째F and finish frying the donuts in batches. Let
            cool for 10 to 15 minutes before glazing.
          </p>

        </li>

        <li><h3>Glaze:</h3>
        <p>If using a glaze, whisk together the ingredients until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Place the donuts, one by one, in the glaze and use a spoon to coat on all sides. Use 2 forks to remove from the glaze and let the excess drip off. Place on the wire rack until the glaze is set.</p><p>Homemade donuts are best eaten within a few hours but will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
